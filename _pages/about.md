Hey there! I'm Vitoria, a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I work in the [Brachio Lab](https://brachiolab.github.io/) ðŸ¦• under the supervision of Professor [Eric Wong](https://riceric22.github.io/). My research focuses on machine learning interpretability and broader topics in trustworthy ML.

I earned my Master of Science in Mathematical Modelling in 2023 and my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics in 2020 from the School of Applied Mathematics at [FundaÃ§Ã£o Getulio Vargas](https://portal.fgv.br/).  During my studies, I was part of the [Visual Data Science Lab](http://www.visualdslab.com/) and worked with Professors [Jorge Poco](http://visualdslab.com/~jpocom/) and [Marcos M. Raimundo](https://ic.unicamp.br/~mraimundo/). My research focused on machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and fairness in ML.

After my master's, I worked as a research scientist at the [Visualization and Data Analytics Research Center](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) with Professor [Claudio Silva](https://ctsilva.github.io/). At NYU, I focused on visualization systems for Explainable AI and topological data analysis, developing tools to help interpret complex ML models.

Thanks for stopping by!
